## What This Is

A proposal to standardize common Software Development Lifecycle operations into well-defined commands that work across teams and projects.

**Built on:**
- Cursor IDE (AI-powered development)
- MCP (connects to Jira, Azure DevOps, GitHub)
- Natural language commands (markdown instructions)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure MCP

**Cursor Settings → Features → Model Context Protocol:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "Atlassian-MCP-Server": {
      "url": "https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Install Commands

```bash
cp -r implementations/cursor/commands/* ~/.cursor/commands/
```

### 3. Use Commands

```
/create-task --type=story for user authentication
/generate-implementation-plan for PROJ-123
/start-task PROJ-123
/complete-task PROJ-123
```

## Available Commands

**8 essential commands:**

- **Product (2):** Create tasks and break down large tasks
- **Development (3):** Plan, build, and ship features
- **Quality (2):** Write tests and review code
- **Utilities (1):** Check MCP status

---

## How It Works

```
You → /command → Cursor AI → MCP → Services (Jira, GitHub)
```

1. You invoke a command (e.g., `/start-task PROJ-123`)
2. Cursor AI reads the command instruction
3. AI uses MCP to interact with Jira, GitHub, filesystem
4. AI executes contextually based on your project

**Result:** Consistent operations across projects and tech stacks.
