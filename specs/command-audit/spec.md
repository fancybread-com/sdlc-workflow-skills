## Blueprint

### Context
Before defining schemas for our 9 Cursor commands (FB-18), we need to validate that their design aligns with ASDLC principles. This spike investigates command coverage, artifact alignment, and pattern implementation to identify gaps and provide actionable refinement recommendations.

**Business Problem**: Commands were designed organically for workflow automation. Without validating against ASDLC patterns first, we risk locking down schemas for misaligned command structures.

**Solution**: Systematic audit of all 9 commands against ASDLC's Factory Architecture, Standardized Parts, and Quality Control pillars.

### Architecture

#### Commands in Scope
| Command | File | Primary Purpose | SDLC Phase |
|---------|------|-----------------|------------|
| `/mcp-status` | `mcp-status.md` | Verify MCP connections | Infrastructure |
| `/create-task` | `create-task.md` | Create work items | Product |
| `/decompose-task` | `decompose-task.md` | Break epics into stories | Product |
| `/refine-task` | `refine-task.md` | Add detail, estimate points | Product |
| `/create-plan` | `create-plan.md` | Create implementation plan | Planning |
| `/start-task` | `start-task.md` | Begin development | Development |
| `/complete-task` | `complete-task.md` | Commit, push, create PR | Development |
| `/create-test` | `create-test.md` | Write tests | Quality |
| `/review-code` | `review-code.md` | AI code review | Quality |

#### ASDLC Artifacts
- **Spec**: Blueprint + Contract (permanent living specification)
- **PBI**: Product Backlog Item (transient execution unit)
- **AGENTS.md**: Agent Constitution (behavioral directives)

#### ASDLC Patterns Referenced
- **The Spec**: Living documents as permanent source of truth
- **The PBI**: Transient execution unit (delta vs state)
- **Context Gates**: Architectural checkpoints (input/output validation)
- **Ralph Loop**: Self-correcting worker pattern
- **Adversarial Code Review**: Critic agent review pattern
- **Constitutional Review**: Validation against Spec + Constitution
- **Living Specs**: Practical guide for evolving specifications

#### Audit Methodology
For each command, perform structured analysis:
1. **Purpose & Phase**: What SDLC phase? What responsibility?
2. **Artifact Analysis**: What does it consume/produce?
3. **Pattern Implementation**: Which ASDLC patterns does it implement?
4. **Field Manual Alignment**: Factory Architecture, Standardized Parts, Quality Control?
5. **Gap Identification**: What's missing?
6. **Recommendation**: Keep, refine, merge, remove, or add new command?

#### Dependencies
- **ASDLC.io MCP server**: Required for pattern queries
- **ASDLC Field Manual v0.9.3**: Reference documentation
- **AGENTS.md (FB-17)**: Context on current command structure
- **All 9 commands**: Located in `implementations/cursor/commands/`

#### Dependency Directions
- **Inbound**: Consumed by FB-18 (schema definition)
- **Outbound**: Depends on ASDLC MCP server, AGENTS.md
- **Blocks**: FB-18 and other Phase 1 refinement stories

### Anti-Patterns

**❌ Analysis Paralysis**
Don't over-research. Time-box the spike. Focus on actionable findings, not academic perfection.

**❌ Implementation During Spike**
This is research only. Don't implement changes. Document recommendations for separate stories.

**❌ Vague Recommendations**
"Command needs improvement" is not actionable. Provide specific changes: "Rename `/create-plan` to `/create-spec` and update output to Blueprint + Contract format."

**❌ Ignoring Practical Workflow**
ASDLC alignment is important, but so is developer productivity. Balance theoretical purity with real-world usability.

**❌ Scope Creep**
Don't audit adjacent systems (CI/CD, documentation). Focus on the 9 commands only.

## Contract

### Definition of Done
- [x] All 9 commands audited with structured analysis
- [x] Gap analysis complete (missing ASDLC practices identified)
- [x] Recommendations provided (specific, actionable stories)
- [x] Command-to-ASDLC mapping documented (Phase, Artifact, Pattern)
- [x] Go/No-Go decision for FB-18 with rationale
- [x] Audit report created and accessible
- [x] Summary posted to FB-36
- [x] Refinement stories created (if needed)

### Regression Guardrails
- **Findings must be actionable**: Every gap identified must have a concrete recommendation
- **Go/No-Go decision required**: FB-18 cannot proceed without clear guidance
- **Command count stability**: Don't recommend adding 10+ new commands (keep command set minimal)
- **Backward compatibility**: Refinements must not break existing workflow without migration path

### Scenarios

**Scenario: Audit identifies misaligned command**
- **Given**: A command that doesn't produce/consume ASDLC artifacts
- **When**: Audit analysis is performed
- **Then**: Recommendation provided with specific refinement (e.g., "Update `/create-plan` to produce Spec instead of plan file")

**Scenario: Audit identifies missing ASDLC practice**
- **Given**: ASDLC pattern not implemented by any command
- **When**: Gap analysis is performed
- **Then**: Either recommend new command OR recommend adding practice to existing command (with rationale)

**Scenario: Go/No-Go decision for FB-18**
- **Given**: Audit complete with findings
- **When**: Synthesizing recommendations
- **Then**: Clear decision: "Go" (proceed with schemas) OR "No-Go" (refine commands first), with rationale and timeline

**Scenario: Deliverables are accessible**
- **Given**: Audit complete
- **When**: Stakeholder reviews findings
- **Then**: Audit report is readable, well-structured, and actionable for next steps

### Expected Outcomes

**Likely Findings**:
- `/create-plan` needs refinement to produce Specs (not just plans)
- `/complete-task` may need Constitutional Review integration
- `/review-code` should implement Adversarial Code Review pattern
- Plan files (`.plans/`) should become Specs (`specs/`)
- Commands need better Spec vs PBI distinction

**Likely Gaps**:
- No explicit Constitutional Review command
- No Ralph Loop support (agent self-correction)
- No Spec maintenance/evolution command
- Quality gates not enforced deterministically

**Likely Recommendations**:
- Refine 3-5 commands to better align with ASDLC
- Add 1-2 new commands for missing practices (or merge into existing)
- Restructure plan files to Spec files (separate story: FB-24)
- Proceed with FB-18 after refinements complete

### Deliverable Structure

**Audit Report** (`docs/asdlc-audit/command-audit-report.md`):
1. Executive Summary (alignment assessment, key findings, critical gaps, go/no-go)
2. Command-by-Command Analysis (for each of 9 commands)
3. Gap Analysis (missing practices, severity)
4. Command-to-ASDLC Mapping (Phase, Artifact, Pattern tables)
5. Recommendations (refine, merge, remove, add)
6. Next Steps (stories to create, FB-18 decision)
