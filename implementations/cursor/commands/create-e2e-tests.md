# Write E2E Tests

## Overview
Generate end-to-end tests to verify complete user workflows work correctly.

## Steps
1. **Identify user workflows**
   - Critical user journeys
   - Most common paths
   - High-value features
   - Complex interactions
   - Multi-step processes

2. **Map workflow steps**
   - User actions (click, type, navigate)
   - Expected outcomes at each step
   - Data required
   - Success criteria

3. **Set up E2E environment**
   - Configure full application stack
   - Set up test database with seed data
   - Configure browser automation (if web app)
   - Prepare test accounts

4. **Generate E2E tests**
   - Use E2E test framework
   - Simulate user interactions
   - Verify UI state changes
   - Check data updates
   - Validate final outcomes

5. **Run and verify**
   - Execute E2E tests
   - Verify complete workflows
   - Check test reliability
   - Review test execution time

- [ ] Tests generated covering:
  - [ ] Critical user journeys
  - [ ] User interactions
  - [ ] UI state changes
  - [ ] Data persistence
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Tests are reliable (not flaky)
- [ ] Test execution time acceptable
