# Commands Reference

**Natural language instructions that AI agents execute with context.**

## What Are Commands?

Commands are **not scripts**. They're markdown files containing instructions that tell AI agents:

- **What** to achieve (the goal)
- **What context** to gather (story, codebase, plans)
- **What decisions** to make (or ask you about)
- **What artifacts** to create (branches, commits, PRs)

The AI reads these instructions and executes them contextually based on your specific project.

### Example: How `/start-task` Works

**The command file says:**
> "Read the story from issue tracker, create a branch following project conventions, read the implementation plan, implement the code matching the project style."

**For a Python Flask project, AI might:**
- Create branch `feature/auth-123`
- Add code to `app/routes/auth.py`
- Write tests in `tests/test_auth.py` using pytest
- Update `requirements.txt`

**For a React TypeScript project, AI might:**
- Create branch `feature/auth-123`
- Add component in `src/components/Auth.tsx`
- Write tests in `src/components/Auth.test.tsx` using Jest
- Update `package.json`

**Same command. Different execution. Context drives behavior.**

## How to Use Commands

### 1. Type `/command-name` in Cursor Chat

```
/start-task PROJ-123
```

### 2. AI Reads the Command File

Cursor loads `start-task.md` and understands the workflow.

### 3. AI Gathers Context

- Reads story from Jira
- Checks your codebase structure
- Reviews implementation plan
- Understands your coding patterns

### 4. AI Executes Contextually

Implements the feature using your frameworks, style, and conventions.

### 5. You Review and Approve

At key decision points, AI asks for your approval (plans, major changes).

## Installation

Choose where you want commands available:

```bash
# Option 1: Global (all projects)
cp -r implementations/cursor/commands/* ~/.cursor/commands/

# Option 2: Per-project
mkdir -p .cursor/commands
cp -r implementations/cursor/commands/* .cursor/commands/

# Option 3: Team (Cursor Enterprise)
# Use Cursor Dashboard → Team Content → Commands
```

**Restart Cursor after installing.**

## Complete Workflows

### Scrum Cycle

```bash
# Sprint Planning
/estimate-stories in EPIC-1
/prioritize-backlog
/plan-sprint 23

# Development (per story)
/create-task-plan for AUTH-10
/start-task AUTH-10
/run-tests
/complete-task AUTH-10

# After merge
/sync-task AUTH-10
```

### Kanban Flow

```bash
# Continuous
/refine-backlog
/estimate-stories (as needed)
/prioritize-backlog

# Development (per story)
/create-task-plan for AUTH-10
/start-task AUTH-10
/run-tests
/complete-task AUTH-10

# After merge
/sync-task AUTH-10
```

**Key difference:** Scrum plans sprints upfront. Kanban refines continuously.

## Key Concepts

### Two Types of Planning

| Product Planning | Dev Planning |
|------------------|--------------|
| **What**: Estimate & prioritize | **What**: Technical design |
| **Who**: Team activity | **Who**: Individual developer |
| **When**: Sprint/refinement | **When**: Before coding |
| **Output**: Prioritized backlog | **Output**: `.plans/` file |
| **Commands**: `/estimate-stories`, `/plan-sprint` | **Commands**: `/create-task-plan` |

### Scrum vs Kanban

| Aspect | Scrum | Kanban |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Cadence** | Fixed sprints | Continuous flow |
| **Planning** | Upfront (`/plan-sprint`) | Ongoing (`/refine-backlog`) |
| **Commitment** | Sprint scope | WIP limits |
| **Metrics** | Velocity | Lead/cycle time |

**Same commands work for both.** Choose based on your process.

## How Commands Work: An Example

You type: `/estimate-stories in EPIC-1`

**What happens:**

1. **AI reads command file** - Understands what "estimate stories" means
2. **Gathers context** - Fetches stories from Jira, analyzes codebase
3. **Applies intelligence** - Compares to similar past work, identifies complexity
4. **Presents findings** - Shows estimates with reasoning
5. **Executes decision** - Updates Jira after your approval

**Output:**
```
Found 5 stories in EPIC-1:
- AUTH-10: 5 points (similar to past OAuth work)
- AUTH-11: 3 points (straightforward)
- AUTH-12: 8 points (new integration, unknown API)

Approve these estimates?
```

**This is context-aware automation, not scripted automation.**

## What Commands Need to Work

Commands connect to your tools via **adapters**:

| Adapter Type | Tools | What It Does |
|--------------|-------|--------------|
| **Issue Management** | Jira, Azure DevOps | Read/create stories, update status |
| **Version Control** | GitHub, GitLab | Create branches, PRs |
| **Plan Storage** | Filesystem | Store plans in `.plans/` |

**Configuration:** Set up via MCP servers. [Setup guide →](../mcp-setup.md)

---

## Customizing Commands

Commands are markdown files. Edit them to match your workflow.

**Example:** Modify `/complete-task` to require specific commit format

```markdown
# Complete Task

## Steps
1. Verify tests pass
2. Create commit with format: `type(scope): message`
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, test, refactor
3. Push and create PR
...
```

Save in `.cursor/commands/complete-task.md`

**Keep it declarative** - Describe *what* to achieve, not *how*.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Command not found** | Restart Cursor. Check `.cursor/commands/` or `~/.cursor/commands/` |
| **Command fails** | Verify MCP servers connected (Settings → MCP) |
| **Jira errors** | Check story exists, you have permissions |
| **GitHub errors** | Verify token has `repo` scope, check write access |
| **Plan not found** | Run `/create-task-plan` first |

## Quick Reference

**Most Common Commands:**

```bash
# Create work
/create-story for [feature]

# Plan
/create-task-plan for [TASK-123]

# Develop
/start-task [TASK-123]
/run-tests
/complete-task [TASK-123]

# After merge
/sync-task [TASK-123]
```

**Scrum Planning:** `/estimate-stories` → `/plan-sprint`
**Kanban Planning:** `/refine-backlog` → `/prioritize-backlog`
