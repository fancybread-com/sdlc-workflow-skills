# Complete Task

## Overview
Commit changes, push to remote, create pull request, and transition issue to "Code Review" status.

## Definitions

- **{TASK_KEY}**: Story/Issue ID from the issue tracker (e.g., `FB-6`, `PROJ-123`, `KAN-42`)
- **Branch Name Format**: Use short format `{type}/{TASK_KEY}` (e.g., `feat/FB-6`, `fix/PROJ-123`)
  - Short format is recommended: `feat/FB-6` (not `feat/FB-6-file-watching-workspace-commands`)
  - **Important**: Be consistent within a project - use the same format for all branches
- **Spec Summary**: Content from spec file located at `specs/{FEATURE_DOMAIN}/spec.md`
  - Contains Blueprint (Context, Architecture, Anti-Patterns) and Contract (DoD, Guardrails, Scenarios)
  - Used in PR body to document feature contracts
- **Plan Summary**: Content from plan file located at `.plans/{TASK_KEY}-*.plan.md`
  - **Plan File Selection**: If multiple files match the pattern `.plans/{TASK_KEY}-*.plan.md`:
    - Use the most recently modified file (check file modification time)
    - If modification time cannot be determined, use the first file found alphabetically
    - Report which file was selected: "Using plan file: {filename}"
  - Contains implementation details, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- **Completed Checklist**: Markdown checklist posted as a comment to the issue showing what work was completed
- **Current Branch**: Should match the expected format `{type}/{TASK_KEY}` (e.g., `feat/FB-6`, `fix/PROJ-123`)

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, verify:

1. **MCP Status Validation**: Perform MCP server status checks (see `mcp-status.md` for detailed steps)
   - Test each configured MCP server connection (Atlassian, GitHub, etc.)
   - Verify all required integrations are authorized and operational
   - **If any MCP server fails validation, STOP and report the failure. Do not proceed.**

2. **Branch Verification**:
   - Verify current branch matches expected format: `{type}/{TASK_KEY}`
   - Confirm branch exists on remote (if not, this will be created on push)
   - **If branch doesn't match expected format, STOP and report the mismatch.**

3. **Test Verification**:
   - Run all tests locally and verify they pass
   - **If any tests fail, STOP and fix them before proceeding. Do not commit failing tests.**

4. **Documentation Files**:
   - Check if spec exists at `specs/{FEATURE_DOMAIN}/spec.md`
   - Check if plan exists at `.plans/{TASK_KEY}-*.plan.md`
   - **Plan File Selection**: If multiple files match the pattern `.plans/{TASK_KEY}-*.plan.md`:
     - Use the most recently modified file (check file modification time)
     - If modification time cannot be determined, use the first file found alphabetically
     - Report which file was selected: "Using plan file: {filename}"
   - **If neither spec nor plan exists, WARN but proceed**: PR will not include detailed context
   
5. **Verify Spec Updated (if applicable)**:
   - If code changes affected API contracts, data models, or quality targets:
     - **Check if spec was updated** in the staged changes
     - If spec exists but wasn't updated: WARN user about Same-Commit Rule violation
     - **Strongly recommend** including spec update in this commit

## Steps

1. **Prepare commit**
   - Check for linting errors and fix them
     - **If linting errors cannot be fixed automatically, STOP and report the issue. Ask user for guidance.**
   - Run all tests locally to ensure they pass
     - **If tests fail, STOP and fix them before committing.**
   - Stage all changes
   - Create conventional commit message
     - Format: `{type}: {description} ({TASK_KEY})`
     - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
     - Description should be clear and concise
     - Example: `feat: add user authentication (PROJ-123)`

2. **Commit and push changes**
   - Commit staged changes with the conventional commit message
   - Push to remote branch
     - **If push fails (e.g., authentication, network, conflicts), STOP and report the error.**
     - **If branch doesn't exist on remote, it will be created on first push.**

3. **Create pull request (optional)**
   - **Note**: PR creation is optional. You may skip this step if you prefer to create the PR manually or if it's not needed.
   - **If creating PR:** CI/CD is a PR gate. Local tests passing is the prerequisite to PR creation. CI/CD will run automatically after PR is created.
   - **If skipping PR:** Proceed directly to Step 5 (Update issue) after pushing.

4. **Create pull request (if proceeding with PR creation)**
   - **After pushing, get the latest commit SHA:**
     - Use `run_terminal_cmd`: `git rev-parse HEAD` to get current commit SHA
     - Or use `mcp_github_list_commits` with `sha` = branch name to get latest commit
   - **Read documentation for PR body:**
     - **First, check for Spec** at `specs/{FEATURE_DOMAIN}/spec.md`:
       - If exists, extract: Context (from Blueprint), Definition of Done (from Contract), key scenarios
       - Include in PR body as "Feature Spec" section
     - **Then, check for Plan** at `.plans/{TASK_KEY}-*.plan.md`:
       - If exists, extract: Story, Context, Scope, Acceptance Criteria, Implementation Steps summary
       - Include in PR body as "Implementation Plan" section
     - **If neither exists**: Note in PR body that no detailed documentation was found
   - **Check if PR already exists:**
     - Use `mcp_github_pull_request_read` with `method="get"` to check for existing PRs
     - If PR exists, update it instead of creating new one
   - Create completed checklist comment for the issue (include PR link if PR was created):
     ```

## Guidance

### Role
Act as a **software engineer** responsible for completing development work on a task and preparing it for code review. You are methodical, thorough, and follow established development workflows and standards.

### Instruction
Execute the complete-task workflow to finalize development work on a specified task. This includes:
1. Performing prerequisite validation checks
2. Preparing and committing changes following conventions
3. Pushing changes to remote
4. Optionally creating a pull request with proper documentation (may be skipped)
5. Updating the issue tracker with completion status

### Context
- The task is tracked in an issue management system (Jira, Azure DevOps, etc.)
- **Specs** may exist at `specs/{FEATURE_DOMAIN}/spec.md` with permanent feature contracts
- **Plans** may exist at `.plans/{TASK_KEY}-*.plan.md` with transient implementation details
- Development work has been completed on a branch following the `{type}/{TASK_KEY}` format
- MCP integrations provide access to issue trackers and version control
- Automated CI/CD pipelines run checks on pushed branches
- The codebase follows conventional commit standards and branch naming conventions
- **Same-Commit Rule**: Spec updates must be committed with code changes that affect behavior/contracts

### Examples

**Example Branch Names:**
- `feat/PROJ-123` (story/feature)
- `fix/FB-6` (bug fix)
- `chore/KAN-42` (maintenance task)
- `refactor/PROJ-321` (refactoring)

**Example Commit Messages:**
- `feat: add user authentication (PROJ-123)`
- `fix: resolve login timeout error (FB-6)`
- `refactor: simplify auth service (PROJ-321)`
- `test: add unit tests for auth module (PROJ-123)`

### Constraints

**Rules (Must Follow):**
1. **Same-Commit Rule Check**: If code changes affected API contracts, data models, or quality targets:
   - Verify spec was updated in staged changes
   - If spec exists but wasn't updated: WARN user and recommend including spec update
   - Spec and code changes must be committed together
2. **Prerequisites Must Pass**: Do not proceed if MCP validation, branch verification, or test verification fails. STOP and report the issue.
3. **Conventional Commits**: All commits must follow the format: `{type}: {description} ({TASK_KEY})`
   - Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
   - Description should be clear and concise
   - Task key must be included in parentheses
4. **Branch Naming**: Current branch must match short format `{type}/{TASK_KEY}` (e.g., `feat/FB-6`, `fix/PROJ-123`)
   - Use short format: `feat/FB-6` (not descriptive format)
   - **Important**: Be consistent - use short format for all branches
5. **Test Requirements**: All tests must pass locally before committing. Do not commit failing tests.
6. **Linting**: All linting errors must be fixed before committing. If errors cannot be fixed automatically, STOP and ask for guidance.
7. **PR Creation is Optional**: PR creation is optional. You may skip PR creation if you prefer to create it manually or if it's not needed. If creating PR:
   - CI/CD runs automatically after PR creation as a gate. Local tests passing is the prerequisite to PR creation. Monitor CI/CD status after PR is created.
   - PR body should include:
     - Feature Spec summary (if spec exists at `specs/{FEATURE_DOMAIN}/spec.md`)
     - Implementation Plan summary (if plan exists at `.plans/{TASK_KEY}-*.plan.md`)
     - If neither exists, note this in PR body
8. **Documentation File Handling**:
   - Check for both spec and plan files
   - If neither exists, WARN but proceed (PR will lack detailed context)
   - Prefer spec content over plan content when both exist
9. **Error Handling**: If any step fails (push, PR creation, issue transition), STOP and report the specific error. Do not proceed with remaining steps.

**Existing Standards (Reference):**
- MCP status validation: See `mcp-status.md` for detailed MCP server connection checks
- Spec guidance: See `specs/README.md` for Same-Commit Rule and when to update specs
- Branch naming: Type prefix format (`{type}/{TASK_KEY}`) as established in `start-task.md`
- Commit message format: `{type}: {description} ({TASK_KEY})` (consistent across commands)
- Documentation locations: Specs at `specs/{FEATURE_DOMAIN}/spec.md`, Plans at `.plans/{TASK_KEY}-*.plan.md`
- Issue workflow: Tasks transition through "To Do" → "In Progress" → "Code Review" → "Done"
- ASDLC patterns: The Spec (permanent state), The PBI (transient delta), Living Specs (Same-Commit Rule)

### Output
1. **Committed Changes**: All changes committed with conventional commit format (including spec updates if behavior changed)
2. **Pushed Branch**: Branch pushed to remote repository
3. **Pull Request (optional)**: If PR creation was chosen, PR created with spec summary (if exists), plan summary (if exists), verification status, and issue link. CI/CD checks will run automatically.
4. **Updated Issue**: Issue updated with completed checklist, status information (PR link if created, or commit/push confirmation if PR skipped), and transitioned to "Code Review" status

All outputs should be verified and any failures should be reported immediately with specific error details.
