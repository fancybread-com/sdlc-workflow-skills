# Skills Directory (skills.sh)

[skills.sh](https://skills.sh) is a directory of Agent Skills and the ecosystem around the [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) from Vercel.

## What It Is

- **Directory** — Browse and discover skills by category or search.
- **CLI** — `npx skills` (from [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)) to add, remove, and manage skills in your environment.

## Minimal Usage

- **Add a skill** — `npx skills add <owner/repo> -a cursor` (for Cursor; choose **Copy** when prompted). Replace `<owner/repo>` with e.g. `fancy-bread/sdlc-workflow-skills`.
