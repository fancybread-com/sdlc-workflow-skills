# ASDLC Alignment: Commands → Patterns

This document provides explicit traceability from commands to ASDLC patterns and pillars, helping users understand the methodology behind the factory.

## Overview

The commands in this project implement ASDLC (Agentic Software Development Lifecycle) patterns and pillars. Each command serves as a specialized station in a Factory Architecture, uses Standardized Parts (schema-enforced structure), and implements Quality Control (validation gates).

## Command Mapping

| Command | ASDLC Patterns | ASDLC Pillar | Description |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| `/create-task` | [The PBI](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-pbi/), [Agent Constitution](https://asdlc.io/patterns/agent-constitution/) | Factory Architecture, Standardized Parts | Creates PBIs with standardized anatomy; workflow station for task creation |
| `/decompose-task` | [The PBI](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-pbi/), [Context Gates](https://asdlc.io/patterns/context-gates/) | Factory Architecture, Quality Control | Decomposition workflow with information-density gate |
| `/refine-task` | [The PBI](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-pbi/), [Context Gates](https://asdlc.io/patterns/context-gates/) | Factory Architecture, Quality Control | Refinement step with Definition of Ready (DoR) as gate |
| `/create-plan` | [The Spec](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-spec/), [The PBI](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-pbi/) | Standardized Parts | Creates Specs (permanent state) or Plans (transient delta) |
| `/start-task` | [The Spec](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-spec/), [The PBI](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-pbi/), [Context Gates](https://asdlc.io/patterns/context-gates/) | Factory Architecture, Quality Control | Command station with pre-flight validation gates |
| `/complete-task` | [Constitutional Review](https://asdlc.io/patterns/constitutional-review/), [The Spec](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-spec/), [The PBI](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-pbi/), [Context Gates](https://asdlc.io/patterns/context-gates/) | Quality Control, Standardized Parts | Review Gate with dual-contract validation (Spec + Constitution) |
| `/create-test` | [The Spec](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-spec/), [Context Gates](https://asdlc.io/patterns/context-gates/) | Quality Control, Standardized Parts | Test generation as output gate; uses Contract scenarios from Spec |
| `/review-code` | [Adversarial Code Review](https://asdlc.io/patterns/adversarial-code-review/), [Constitutional Review](https://asdlc.io/patterns/constitutional-review/), [The Spec](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-spec/) | Quality Control | Review Gate using Critic Agent for dual-contract validation |
| `/mcp-status` | [Context Gates](https://asdlc.io/patterns/context-gates/) | Quality Control | Pre-flight validation gate for other commands |
| `/setup-asdlc` | [Agent Constitution](https://asdlc.io/patterns/agent-constitution/), [The Spec](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-spec/), [Standardized Parts](https://asdlc.io/patterns/standardized-parts/) | Factory Architecture, Standardized Parts | Repository initialization command that creates AGENTS.md template and directory structure |

## ASDLC Pillars

The three ASDLC pillars are implemented across the command set:

- **Factory Architecture**: Specialized command stations that handle specific workflow phases

- **Standardized Parts**: Schema-enforced commands with consistent structure and validation

- **Quality Control**: Automated validation gates that ensure correctness before proceeding


## Pattern Details

### Core Patterns

- **[The Spec](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-spec/)**: Living documents as permanent source of truth for features
- **[The PBI](https://asdlc.io/patterns/the-pbi/)**: Transient execution units that reference permanent Specs
- **[Context Gates](https://asdlc.io/patterns/context-gates/)**: Architectural checkpoints that filter input context and validate output artifacts

### Review Patterns

- **[Constitutional Review](https://asdlc.io/patterns/constitutional-review/)**: Verification pattern validating against both Spec and Constitution
- **[Adversarial Code Review](https://asdlc.io/patterns/adversarial-code-review/)**: Consensus verification using Critic Agent

### Governance Patterns

- **[Agent Constitution](https://asdlc.io/patterns/agent-constitution/)**: Persistent high-level directives shaping agent behavior

## How Commands Implement ASDLC

The command mapping table above shows which patterns each command implements. Key implementation details:

- **Context Gates**: Multiple commands implement validation checkpoints (see commands with Context Gates in the mapping table)
- **The Spec Pattern**: Commands create, read, or validate against Specs (permanent state documents)
- **The PBI Pattern**: Commands create or work with PBIs (transient execution units that reference Specs)
- **Constitutional Review**: Commands validate against both functional requirements (Spec) and architectural values (Constitution)
