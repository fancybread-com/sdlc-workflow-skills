# `/mcp-status` - Check MCP Server Connections

**Verify authentication status of all configured MCP servers.**

## Quick Start

```bash
/mcp-status
```

No arguments needed. Returns status of all configured MCP integrations.

## What It Does

Checks each configured MCP server (Jira, GitHub, etc.) to verify:
- ✅ Server is reachable
- ✅ Authentication is valid
- ⚠️ Which servers need reconnection

## Example Output

**All connected:**
```
🔌 MCP Server Status

Configured servers:
  ✅ Atlassian-MCP-Server - Connected
  ✅ github - Connected

All systems operational!
```

**Action needed:**
```
🔌 MCP Server Status

Configured servers:
  ❌ Atlassian-MCP-Server - Needs authentication
  ✅ github - Connected

⚠️ To reconnect:
Settings → Tools & MCP → Click "Connect"
```

## When to Use

| Scenario | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Start of work** | Verify connections before running commands |
| **After idle time** | MCP servers disconnect after inactivity |
