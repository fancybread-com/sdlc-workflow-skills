# /create-plan

Create a detailed technical implementation plan for a story by analyzing requirements, reviewing the codebase, and generating a structured plan document.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Roles** | All Engineers |
| **Frequency** | Weekly (every story) |
| **Prerequisites** | Story with acceptance criteria, MCP integrations configured |

---

## What It Does

Fetches story from issue tracker, analyzes codebase for similar implementations and patterns, designs technical approach, and generates a structured plan document with file changes, test strategy, and implementation steps. Posts plan summary to the issue.

---

## Usage

```bash
/create-plan for TASK-123
```

---

## Example

```
You: /create-plan for FB-6

AI:
✓ MCP status validation passed
✓ Fetching story FB-6: File watching for workspace commands
✓ Story has 5 acceptance criteria
✓ Analyzing codebase for similar implementations...
✓ Found 3 similar file watching patterns
✓ Reviewing existing test patterns...
✓ Designing implementation approach...
✓ Breaking down into 4 subtasks...
✓ Generating plan document...
✓ Plan saved: .plans/FB-6-file-watching.plan.md
✓ Posting plan summary to issue...
✓ Plan created successfully

Plan includes:
- Story and context
- Scope (in/out)
- 5 acceptance criteria
- Technical design with components
- 4 implementation steps with file changes
- Test strategy (unit + integration)
- Dependencies documented
```

---

## Definitions

- **{TASK_KEY}**: Story/Issue ID from the issue tracker (e.g., `FB-6`, `PROJ-123`, `KAN-42`)
- **Branch Name Format**: Use short format `{type}/{TASK_KEY}` (e.g., `feat/FB-6`, `fix/PROJ-123`)
  - Short format is recommended: `feat/FB-6` (not `feat/FB-6-file-watching-workspace-commands`)
  - **Important**: Be consistent within a project - use the same format for all branches
- **Plan Document**: Technical implementation plan saved at `.plans/{TASK_KEY}-{description}.plan.md`
  - Contains story details, technical design, implementation steps, and testing strategy
- **User Story Format**: Typically follows "As a [user type], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable conditions (minimum 3-5 required)

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, the command verifies:

1. **MCP Status Validation**: All MCP servers (Atlassian, GitHub) are connected and authorized
2. **Story Exists**: Story exists in issue tracker and can be fetched
3. **Story Has Sufficient Detail**: Story has clear description, 3-5 acceptance criteria, and context

---

## Steps

1. **Analyze story**
   - Fetch story from issue tracker using MCP tools
   - Parse user story format (persona, goal, benefit)
   - Extract acceptance criteria (STOP if none found)
   - Identify technical requirements
   - Check for missing information (STOP if critical info missing)

2. **Analyze codebase**
   - Search for similar implementations using `codebase_search`
   - Identify affected components and files
   - Review existing patterns (structure, testing, naming, error handling)
   - Review related test files for patterns
   - Note blockers or unclear patterns

3. **Design implementation**
   - Break down into 3-7 logical subtasks
   - Identify files to create/modify (with exact paths)
   - Plan database changes (if applicable)
   - Design API changes (if applicable)
   - Plan test strategy (unit, integration, test data)
   - Document dependencies
   - Plan error handling

4. **Generate plan document**
   - Create plan file at `.plans/{TASK_KEY}-{kebab-case-description}.plan.md`
   - Write plan with required sections: Story, Context, Scope, Acceptance Criteria, Technical Design, Implementation Steps, Testing, Dependencies, Status
   - Verify plan file was created
   - Post plan summary to issue tracker with link and key steps

---

## Tools

The command uses explicit MCP and codebase tools:

- **MCP Atlassian**: Get issue, get remote issue links, add comments (with CloudId acquisition guidance)
- **MCP GitHub**: Get issue, add issue comment
- **Filesystem**: Check for existing plan files, write plan document, read code files
- **Codebase**: Search for similar implementations, grep for patterns, find test files
- **Terminal**: Find commands, git log searches

---

## Key Features

- **Story validation**: Ensures story has sufficient detail before proceeding
- **Codebase analysis**: Finds similar implementations to follow existing patterns
- **Structured plan**: Generates plan with all required sections
- **Plan file naming**: Uses kebab-case format `{TASK_KEY}-{description}.plan.md`
- **Issue integration**: Posts plan summary to issue automatically
- **Error handling**: Clear STOP conditions with specific guidance

---

## Plan Document Structure

The generated plan includes:

1. **Story**: User story format or clear description
2. **Context**: Background, motivation, related issues
3. **Scope**: What's included and explicitly excluded
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Numbered, testable criteria
5. **Technical Design**: Architecture, components, data model, API design
6. **Implementation Steps**: Ordered subtasks with file changes
7. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, test data
8. **Dependencies**: External and internal dependencies
9. **Status**: Checklist for tracking progress

- Plan Document: Structured markdown plan file
- User Story Format: "As a... I want... So that..."

## Prerequisites
- MCP status validation
- Story exists and has sufficient detail
- Story has 3-5 acceptance criteria

## Steps
1. Analyze story (fetch, parse, extract criteria)
