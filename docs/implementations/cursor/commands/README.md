## Command Files

All commands are markdown files in the `commands/` directory:
- Each `.md` file contains instructions that Cursor's AI interprets to execute the workflow
- Commands adapt to your project's structure, frameworks, and conventions

Each `.md` file contains instructions that Cursor's AI interprets to execute the workflow.
