# Cursor Commands

Natural language commands for Cursor IDE. Type `/command-name` in Cursor chat to trigger workflows.

**Canonical command definitions** (the markdown files Cursor executes) live in the repo at **`implementations/cursor/commands/`**. Those files are the source of truth. This page describes how to install and use them.

**User-oriented documentation** (what each command does, usage, examples) is in [Commands](../../../commands/index.md).

## Command File Format

Each `.md` file in `implementations/cursor/commands/` contains structured instructions (Definitions, Prerequisites, Steps, Tools, Guidance) that Cursor's AI interprets to run the workflow. Commands are plain markdown—no compilation. They adapt to your project's structure, frameworks, and conventions.

---

## Configuration

Commands require MCP servers for Jira/ADO and GitHub. See [MCP Setup](../mcp-setup.md).

---

## Troubleshooting

**Commands not showing?**
Restart Cursor after copying files.

**Command fails?**
Check MCP servers are configured in Cursor Settings.

**Integration error?**
Verify credentials and permissions in MCP settings.
